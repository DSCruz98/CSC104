    <h1>A Lover's Complaint</h1>

    <h2>
      <p>FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded</p>
      <p>A plaintful story from a sistering vale,</p>
      <p>My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,</p>
      <p>And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;</p>
      <p>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,</p>
      <p>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</p>
      <p>Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.</p>
    <br />
      <p>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</p>
      <p>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</p>
      <p>Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</p>
      <p>The carcass of beauty spent and done:</p>
      <p>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</p>
      <p>Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,</p>
      <p>Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.</p>
    <br />
      <p>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</p>
      <p>Which on it had conceited characters,</p>
      <p>Laundering the silken figures in the brine</p>
      <p>That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,</p>
      <p>And often reading what contents it bears;</p>
      <p>As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,</p>
      <p>In clamours of all size, both high and low.</p>
    <br />
      <p>Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,</p>
      <p>As they did battery to the spheres intend;</p>
      <p>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</p>
      <p>To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</p>
      <p>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</p>
      <p>To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,</p>
      <p>The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.</p>
    <br />
      <p>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</p>
      <p>Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride</p>
      <p>For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,</p>
      <p>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</p>
      <p>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</p>
      <p>And true to bondage would not break from thence,</p>
      <p>Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</p>
