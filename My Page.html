    <h3>
      Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy
      tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) originally created and designed by Gary
      Gygax and Dave Arneson. The game was derived from miniature wargames but
      departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their
      own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters
      embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting (ususally) while a Dungeon
      Master acts as referee and storyteller.
