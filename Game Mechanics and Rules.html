    <h3>
      To begin this process you will select a Species and a Class that best
      suits the idea you have in mind. After that you will need to assign scores
      to six core abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma. You can determine these scores using different
      methods, including Point Buy, where you allocate points based on a defined
      system; Standard Array, which uses a predetermined set of scores (15, 14,
      13, 12, 10, 8); or by Rolling, where you roll 4d6, drop the lowest die,
      and assign the results. The last bit of flavor for your character comes in
      the form of a background, whatever your character was doing before
      starting the current adventure. These backgrounds can add greater identity
      to your characters and help you develop their personallity.

    <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>
      In D&D 5E, most actions are determined by rolling a 20-sided die (d20).
      When rolling, you add relevant modifiers based on your ability scores,
      proficiency, and other factors. The Dungeon Master (DM) sets a Difficulty
      Class (DC) for various tasks, and your total must meet or exceed this DC
      for you to succeed. Additionally, the game incorporates an
      advantage/disadvantage mechanic: if you have advantage, you roll two d20s
      and take the higher result; if you have disadvantage, you roll two d20s
      and take the lower result.
    </h3>
    <h2>Combat</h2>

    <h3>
      Combat in D&D 5E begins with determining initiative. Each player rolls a
      d20 and adds their Dexterity modifier to establish the order of turns. On
      your turn, you can typically take one action (like attacking or casting a
      spell), one bonus action (if applicable), and move up to your character's
      speed. When making an attack, roll a d20 and add your attack modifier. If
      the total meets or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.
      If you hit, you then roll the appropriate dice for damage and subtract the
      resulting total from the target's hit points.
    </h3>
    <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
    <h3>
      As your adventure progresses, whether through combat or other means your
      characters will eventually get the opportunity to level up and gain new
      powers and skills. These new skills can help to differentiate your
      character from others and give you a wider array of options for
      roleplaying and combat.
