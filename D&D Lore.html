    <h3>
      The Forgotten Realms is a rich and expansive campaign setting for Dungeons
      & Dragons, primarily located on the continent of Faerûn. Known for its
      detailed lore, diverse cultures, and complex histories, the realms feature
      a pantheon of gods that significantly influences mortal affairs, often
      driving plotlines. Faerûn boasts a variety of environments, from bustling
      cities like Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate to mysterious locations such as
      the Underdark and ancient forests. Magic is prevalent, with powerful
      spells and magical creatures coexisting alongside classic fantasy races
      like elves, dwarves, and dragons. The setting is also shaped by numerous
      factions—guilds, religious orders, and political groups—competing for
      power and influence.
